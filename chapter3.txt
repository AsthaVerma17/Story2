He went to the window and looked outside. It was dark. There were leaves swirling and suddenly he saw something coming towards him. He was a little scared 
but he wanted to know who he was. He was a beautiful big blue horse. This horse came near the window and said " Hi Shubho ! I am Chetak."

"Shubho couldn't believe if a talking horse was in front of him". Chetak told him that he is the same Chetak who loved his breave master more than anything. 
He asked shubho to sit on him and have a ride.
